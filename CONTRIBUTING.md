# Git Commit Guidelines

Taken from https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md and modified as required.
**If something is missing here and exists in original guidelines and we should use it, please update this page too with that.**

## Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on github as well as in various git tools.

### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **style**: CSS Changes
* **cleanup**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, dead code removal etc.)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests or fixing them
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
generation
* **tracking**: Any kind of tracking which includes Bug Tracking, User Tracking, Anyalytics, AB-Testing etc
* **docs**: Documentation only changes

### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place/context of the commit change. For example `editor`,
`reports`, `FileName`, `ServiceName`, `DirectiveName`, `FunctionName` etc..

### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference issues that this commit **Closes**.
