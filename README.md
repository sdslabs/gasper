## Overview

### The Dilemma
Imagine you have a couple of *Bare Metal Servers* and/or *Virtual Machines* (collectively called nodes) at your disposal. Now you want to deploy a couple of applications/services to these nodes in such a manner so as to not put too much load on a single node.

### Naive Approach
Your 1st option is to manually decide which application goes to which node, then use ssh/telnet to manually
setup all of your applications in each node one by one.

### A Wise Choice
But you are smarter than that, hence you go for the 2nd option which is [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). You setup Kubernetes in all of your
nodes which forms a cluster, and now you can deploy your applications without worrying about load distribution. But
Kubernetes requires a lot of configuration for each application(deployments, services, stateful-sets etc) not to mention
pipelines for creating the corresponding docker image.

### The Ultimatum
Here comes (ü•Ådrumroll please ü•Å) **Gasper**, your 3rd option!<br>
Gasper builds and runs applications in docker containers **directly from source code**. You no longer need to create application specific docker images and build pipelines, let Gasper do the heavylifting for you üòä.
Gasper requires minimal parameters for deploying an application, so minimal that you can count them on fingers in one hand ü§ö. Same goes for Gasper provisioned databases. Gone are the days of hard labour (writing configurations).

## Features

Fear not because the reduction in complexity doesn't imply the reduction in features. You can rest assured because Gasper has:-

* Worker services for creating/managing databases and applications
* Master service for:-
    * Checking the status of worker services
    * Intelligently distributing applications/databases among them
    * Transferring applications from one worker node to another in case of node failure
    * Removing dead worker nodes from the cloud
* REST API interface for the entire ecosystem
* Reverse-proxy service with HTTPS, HTTP/2, Websocket and gRPC support for accessing deployed applications
* DNS service which automatically creates DNS entries for all applications which in turn are resolved inside containers
* SSH service for providing ssh access directly to an application's docker container
* Virtual terminal for interacting with your application's docker container from your browser
* Dynamic addition/removal of nodes and services without configuration changes or restarts
* Compatibility with Linux, Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD and OpenBSD
* All of the above packaged with ‚ù§Ô∏è in a **single binary**

## Supported Languages

Gasper currently supports applications of the following types:-

* Static web pages
* PHP
* Python 2
* Python 3
* Node.js
* Golang
* Ruby

It ain't much but it's honest work ü•≥

## Supported Databases

The following databases are supported by Gasper:-

* MySQL
* MongoDB

It ain't.... (complete the rest yourself)

    ```bash
    $ go version
    go version go1.13.5 darwin/amd64
    ```

2. Clone this repository.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/sdslabs/gasper
    ```

3. Go inside the cloned directory and list available *makefile* commands.

    ```bash
    $ cd gasper && make help
